        <h2>What Is It?</h2>
            <p>The Water Crisis affects countries from all around the wrold such as India, Yemen, Syria, UAE, Qatar, and more. We created this webpage to inform the public about how serious this crisis is and what you can do about it.</p>
        <h2>"785 million people don't have access to clean water" - water.org</h2>
            <p>According to <a href ="https://water.org">water.org</a>, 1 in 9 people don't have access to clean, drinking water. Water is a fundamental resource to all living things and without it, staying alive becomes extremely difficult. Every 2min, a child dies from a water related disease. Even going a day without water is hazardous.</p>
        <h2>Who does it affect?</h2>
            <p>Everyone is directly or directly affected by the water crisis. However, it is women and girls who suffer  the most. Each day, women and girls spend 226 Million hours to find water. Also, dry countires and those who are the most poor have to face this conflict every day. If you are cruel and still don't care, $18.5 billion dollars would be a result of  universal access to water.</p>
        <h2>What can you do about it?</h2>
            <p>Solving the water crisis will take some time but that doesn't mean you're actions don't matter! Here are some things you can do to help:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't let the sink run.</li>
                <li>Don't spend 2hr in the shower!</li>
                <li>Try keeping track of how much water you use and see if there are places you can cut your water use.</li>
            </ul>
